## Developer API

KartaEmeraldCurrency provides a clean, easy-to-use API for developers. All data-related methods are asynchronous and return a `CompletableFuture`.

### Accessing the API

First, get the service from Bukkit's `ServicesManager`.

```java
import com.minekarta.kec.api.KartaEmeraldService;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.plugin.RegisteredServiceProvider;

public class MyPlugin {
    private KartaEmeraldService economyService;

    public void onEnable() {
        RegisteredServiceProvider<KartaEmeraldService> rsp = Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(KartaEmeraldService.class);
        if (rsp != null) {
            this.economyService = rsp.getProvider();
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Usage: Paying a Player

```java
import com.minekarta.kec.api.TransferReason;

public void rewardPlayer(Player player, long amount) {
    if (economyService != null) {
        // Transfer from no one (server) by using a null UUID for the 'from' parameter is not supported.
        // Instead, use the addBankBalance method for server-to-player transactions.
        economyService.addBankBalance(player.getUniqueId(), amount).thenAccept(success -> {
            if (success) {
                player.sendMessage("You have been rewarded " + amount + " emeralds!");
            }
        });
    }
}
```
